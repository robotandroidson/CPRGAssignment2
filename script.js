It was originally planned to be a 6 day race held between May 31-July 5, 1903 as a 5 stage race through Lyon, Marseille, Bordeaux, Nantes and ending in Paris. However, low enrolment by cyclists inspired Desgrange to change it to 6 stages (adding Toulouse), increasing the length of time to complete the race to 18 days, and increasing the prize purse to be 6 times the amount an average worker would earn in one year. With the increased enrolment, the race went ahead from July 1-July 19 1903. The race was exceedingly difficult, and many riders dropped out after the initial stages. Maurice Garin held first position through most of the race and ended up winning the first tour. In the end, circulation for L’Auto doubled during the race, and Desgrange was successful in promoting the newspaper with this race.";

    document.getElementById('changep').textContent="In 1904, the second race was held. However, this time around, cheating and fighting were rampant through the race and even the first winner, Maurice Garin, was disqualified. It was due to this behaviour that Desgrange changed the format of the race to a points system from 1906-1912. It did not matter how fast or slow you finished a stage, it mattered your place in the peloton. In this way, riders rode together at a relaxed pace until close to the finish line, this would later be coined “bicycle stage racing”. In 1910, mountain stages were introduced which greatly increased difficulty. Cyclists were forced to mend their own bicycles and were required to use the same one for the entirety of the race. In 1930, Desgrange finally allowed cyclists to have their bikes mended by a team and were allowed to change bicycles if broken. Desgrange attempted many methods for levelling the playing field such as introducing regional teams that were made up of cyclists from all levels, banning gears, banning metal rims, and even suggesting he provide the same bicycle for each rider. Desgrange died in 1940 and the race organization was taken over by Jacques Goddet. In 1939, the race was interrupted by World War 2 and did not return until 1947.";

The Green Jersey points system was implemented in 1953. National teams were now allowed entry, resulting in greater worldwide excitement and coverage of the race. By the 1960s, there was a reduction in popularity of cycling and the industry was threatened to fold. Due to this, the race was allowed to be promoted by bicycle manufacturers to market their products. Therefore “trade” teams were allowed rather than national teams, meaning a team composed of many nationalities would be sponsored by a corporation. Jacques Anquetil was the first rider to win the race 5 times in 1957, and 1961-1964. Into the 1960s, doping became a prominent issue and a rider named Tom Simpson even died from the side effects in 1967. To resolve the doping issue, stages had daily kilometre limits, more rest days, and drug testing. ";

In 1984, a women’s version of the race called Tour de France Femenin which was won by Marianne Martin.It was in the mid 1980s that the race faced financial issues and organizers even attempted to hold a tour in the USA called Tour de America which was a financial failure.
