        <p id="changep">The first Tour de France was planned as a marketing ploy by the newspaper L’Auto to increase readership devised by newspaper editor Henri Desgrange. It was originally planned to be a 6 day race held between May 31-July 5, 1903 as a 5 stage race through Lyon, Marseille, Bordeaux, Nantes and ending in Paris. However, low enrolment by cyclists inspired Desgrange to change it to 6 stages (adding Toulouse), increasing the length of time to complete the race to 18 days, and increasing the prize purse to be 6 times the amount an average worker would earn in one year. With the increased enrolment, the race went ahead from July 1-July 19 1903. The race was exceedingly difficult, and many riders dropped out after the initial stages. Maurice Garin held first position through most of the race and ended up winning the first tour. In the end, circulation for L’Auto doubled during the race, and Desgrange was successful in promoting the newspaper with this race.</p>
